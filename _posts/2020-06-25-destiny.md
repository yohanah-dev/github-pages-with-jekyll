Time,
When you want it to stay 
It flyâ€™s away 
When you want it to go by
It stays so every moment is felt
You could never be kept at bay

In time there is a life that passes
Time gives and takes precious moments
Leaving us with the past that left memories 
The future of uncertainty 
And the present to make the rest of our history
